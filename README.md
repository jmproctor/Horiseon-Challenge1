# Horiseon-Challenge1

## Purpose 
Editted the starter found at https://github.com/jmproctor/School-1/tree/master/01-HTML-Git-CSS/02-Challenge to reorganize the page and add semantic elements.
using the elements that I learned in Module 1, I added the Header, Section, and Footer elements. I also made use of the .class and ID on the elements to consolidate the CSS file. I did most of my work however on the original clone I made of the assignment, so this is missing a lot of my progress through the Challenge, without going to the link at the beginning of this paragraph.
